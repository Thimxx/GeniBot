# GeniBot
a multi-tasking bot that works on Geni.com, a collaborative geneology site (or as I prefer, a wikipedia of humanity).

For the moment, it is purely for my own use (catered to my personal preferences for Chinese names) from the command line. Anyone is welcome to use on their own, by simply requesting your access token from https://www.geni.com/platform/developer/api_explorer and add to the beginning of geni_api.py

Feedback is most welcomed!
