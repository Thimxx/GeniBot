# GeniBot
a multi-tasking bot on Geni.com, a collaborative geneology site (or as I prefer, a wikipedia of humanity).

For the moment, it is purely for my own use from the command line (not error-prrof, and particularly catered to my personal preferences for Chinese names). Anyone is welcome to use on their own, simply by requesting your own access token from https://www.geni.com/platform/developer/api_explorer and add to the beginning of geni_api.py

Feedback is most welcomed!

Per Geni policy, I must add that it is NOT in any way endorsed by Geni.com
